### File Structure
```
project/
├── index.html          # Main HTML structure
├── styles.css          # CSS styling and responsive design

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

### Data Storage
The application uses the browser's localStorage API to store todo data in JSON format. Each todo item contains:
- `id`: Unique identifier (timestamp)
- `text`: Task description
- `completed`: Boolean status
- `createdAt`: ISO timestamp

## Customization

### Adding Sample Data
To add sample data for demonstration, uncomment the last line in `script.js`:
```javascript
addSampleData();
```

### Styling Customization
The application uses CSS custom properties and can be easily customized by modifying the color variables in `styles.css`.

### Feature Extensions
The modular JavaScript architecture makes it easy to add new features:
- Due dates for tasks
- Task categories/tags
- Priority levels
- Export/import functionality
- Dark mode toggle

## Performance Features

- **Efficient Rendering**: Only re-renders necessary DOM elements
- **Event Delegation**: Optimized event handling for dynamic content
- **Debounced Input**: Smooth user experience with proper input handling
- **Memory Management**: Clean event listener management to prevent memory leaks

## Security Considerations

- **XSS Prevention**: All user input is properly escaped before rendering
- **Input Validation**: Task text is trimmed and validated before storage
- **Local Storage**: Data is stored locally in the browser, ensuring privacy

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- [ ] Task categories and tags
- [ ] Due dates and reminders
- [ ] Task priority levels
- [ ] Drag and drop reordering
- [ ] Export to CSV/JSON
- [ ] Dark/Light theme toggle
