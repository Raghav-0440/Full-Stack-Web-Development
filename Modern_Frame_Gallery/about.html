                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        Founded in 2010, The Modern Frame emerged from a vision to create a space where contemporary art could thrive and challenge conventional boundaries. What began as a small gallery in downtown Metro has grown into one of the most respected contemporary art spaces in the region.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our founder, Isabella Rodriguez, envisioned a gallery that would not only showcase innovative artworks but also foster meaningful dialogue between artists, collectors, and art enthusiasts. Over the years, we've hosted over 200 exhibitions featuring both emerging and established artists from around the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Modern Frame has become known for its commitment to artistic excellence, innovative curation, and dedication to supporting artists in their creative journey. We believe that art has the power to transform perspectives, inspire change, and connect people across cultures and experiences.

                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>
                        At The Modern Frame, we are committed to showcasing contemporary art that pushes boundaries, challenges perspectives, and inspires meaningful dialogue. We believe in the power of art to reflect our times, question our assumptions, and imagine new possibilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our mission extends beyond simply displaying artwork. We strive to create an inclusive environment where artists can experiment, grow, and share their unique visions with the world. We support emerging artists while also celebrating the work of established contemporary masters.
